What is Bayes' theorem?

The theorem states that if there are two events A and B. 
Then the probability of event A given the event B has already happend.
Is equal to the probability of B given that A has happend, multiplied
by the probability of A and divided by the probability of B.

Put in plain english. This finds the true probability. The video
below does a great job at explaining.
