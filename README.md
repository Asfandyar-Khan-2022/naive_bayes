What is Bayes' theorem?

The theorem states that if there are two events A and B. 
Then the probability of event A given the event B has already happend.
Is equal to the probability of B given that A has happend, multiplied
by the probability of A and divided by the probability of B.

Put in plain english. This finds the true probability. The video
below does a great job at explaining.

The pictures below shows the naive bayes theorem (same thing reworded).

The feature vectors. This makes the assumption that all features are mutually independent.

With chain rule applied the following is found.

The value of importantce is the call with the highest probability. The equations is transposed to find the value.

The class conditional probability for the equation above is found with the equation below.
